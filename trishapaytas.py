    And I said I didn't want to die
    But I did, now I know the reason why
    (I'm so alive)
    It's because of the sky
    Can you guess it right now?
    Are you wondering how?
    I found love so fast
    And I know this love will last
    How do I know?
    How do I know?
    He's with me from the start
    He was always in my heart
    Do I straight for, here you are
    Jesus my superstar
    I love you, Jesus
    I love you, Jesus
    You give me reason
    You give me hope
    Jesus never let me go
    You can act bad, or you can be good
    You can be from privilege or straight from the hood
    But Jesus loves you, this we know
    Never leave your side and he'll lead you home
    He's with me from the start
    He was always in my heart
    Do I straight for, here you are
    Jesus my superstar
    I love you, Jesus
    I love you, Jesus
    You give me reason
    You give me hope
    Jesus never let me go
    There was a time I overdosed
    And I was lifted, not by the ambulance
    But by the holy ghost
    He's with me from the start
    He was always in my heart
    Do I straight for, here you are
    Jesus my superstar
    I love you, Jesus
    I love you, Jesus
    You give me reason
    You give me hope
    Jesus never let me go
    I love you, Jesus
    I love you, Jesus
    You give me reason
    You give me hope
    Jesus never let me go""")
